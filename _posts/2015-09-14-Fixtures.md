### Fixtures
Note: Initial load data fixtures are deprecated.  You can do this manually for one off
otherwise you should use [data migrations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/migrations/)
[Django Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/howto/initial-data/)

### Transfer to Heroku
* Dump the data into a fixtures directory. I highly recommend using --indent as
it makes for cleaner data files
* Make sure to dump the auth.user app as well as any of your internal apps for the proejct
* Check in, commit and push to heroku
* Do the load data: heroku run python manage.py loaddata <your file name>
* This should load everything for you
