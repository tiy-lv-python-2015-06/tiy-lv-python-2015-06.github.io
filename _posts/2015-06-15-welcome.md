Welcome to the first Python class at The Iron Yard Las Vegas! It is time to
start getting ready for the class and get a glimpse at what the next few
months have in store for you and your classmates. Here are some things you need
to get squared away before we kick off in a few weeks:

* [Get and setup your Mac](setup)
* [Read through the syllabus](syllabus)
* [Complete your prework](prework)


The prework is not trivial so you need to get started as soon as possible to
give yourself enough time before you start on June 29th.
